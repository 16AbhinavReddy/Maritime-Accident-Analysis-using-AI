"At about 1750 on 18 January 2018, the prawn trawler Nancy Glen (TT100) capsized and later sank in Lower Loch Fyne, Scotland. Weather conditions were benign, and rescuers were quickly at the scene; however, only one of the three crew survived. Nancy Glen was trawling at the time of the accident and the combined effect of a turn to starboard at the same time as the starboard net filling with mud caused the vessel to rapidly heel to starboard, then capsize. Through life modifications to the vessel had reduced its stability, increasing its vulnerability to capsize. Realising the seriousness of the situation, one crewman dashed to escape. However, the darkness, disorientation, rapid nature of the capsize event and inrush of water to the wheelhouse will have denied the other two crew members the opportunity to escape.","It is critical that fishing vessels have sufficient stability to meet their operating profile. Nancy Glen’s stability was insufficient to overcome the circumstances of a net digging into the seabed concurrently with the vessel turning.

Recent modifications to Nancy Glen had a detrimental effect on the vessel’s stability but no checks had been carried out to assess the effect on stability.

Although voluntary guidance was available, there was no mandatory requirement for owners of small fishing vessels to carry out stability assessments.","Lower Loch Fyne, Scotland",Capsize and sinking of prawn trawler Nancy Glen with loss of 2 lives,18 January 2018,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

His role was to remove twistlocks from containers before they were loaded onto waiting trailers. This meant routinely working in the immediate proximity of moving vehicles transporting loaded containers. During the offloading operation, a container was being handled by a forklift truck. The able seaman was out of the field of view of the fork-lift truck driver who was manoeuvring his vehicle in preparation for loading the container onto a waiting trailer.

The vessel had been extensively modified during its life which had significantly reduced its margin of positive stability. On the day of the accident the Nicola Faith had been loaded with catch and retrieved strings of pots to the point of instability, which resulted in the capsize and subsequently sinking of the vessel. Nicola Faith had not been fitted with a mandatory emergency beacon to alert to the capsize, and it was not reported as overdue until 1000 the next day.

"In the early hours of 7 December 1994 the UK registered passenger vessel Canberra, with 1,495 passengers and 931 crew on board, suffered a loss of propulsive and main electrical power. At the time of the incident Canberra was seven miles south-east of the Isle of Wight bound for Southampton. The sea was rough and the wind was south-by-west force 8. Following the change of boiler fuel supply from one set of tanks to another, pressure fluctuations were experienced so that the supply was changed back to the original tanks. The fuel pressure then dropped and main steam pressure was lost. This in turn resulted in the loss of main propulsion motors and all electric power. The emergency generators activated and supplied power for lighting and services. The Coastguard was alerted by Canberra’s “ SECURITE” message; subsequently an Urgency “PAN PAN” signal was broadcast and tugs in the Solent area were alerted. Just over two hours after the start of the incident, full electrical power was regained, but weighing of anchors was delayed because one anchor had fouled the cable of the other. The first tugs arrived on scene three hours after having first been alerted, and after successfully weighing and stowing anchors Canberra proceeded without assistance to Southampton where she berthed later that morning.","the loss of steam pressure was due to a failure in the fuel oil supply which in most part was due to inadequate procedures and supervision

"About 0100 eastern daylight time on September 8, 2019, after unloading and loading vehicle cargo during the previous day, the 656-foot-long, Republic of the Marshall Islands-flagged roll-on/roll-off vehicle carrier Golden Ray departed the Colonel’s Island Terminal in the Port of Brunswick, Georgia, en route to Baltimore, Maryland. A state pilot from the Port of Brunswick navigated the vessel as it proceeded outbound through the Brunswick River and into St. Simons Sound. The pilot navigated the vessel through two left turns, and, as the vessel approached the right turn into Plantation Creek Range, which led to the Atlantic Ocean, the pilot gave rudder orders to the helmsman to turn the vessel to starboard. As the vessel turned to starboard, it began to heel quickly to port. The pilot and the vessel’s master began rapidly issuing rudder commands in an attempt to counter the heeling. However, the Golden Ray continued to heel over, the rate of turn to starboard increased, and the vessel heeled to port to about 60° in less than a minute. Water entered deck 5 through the vessel’s open portside pilot door and flooded through open watertight doors to the engine and steering gear rooms. The vessel eventually settled on its port side at an angle of 90°. The US Coast Guard responded to the accident, along with tugboats and pilot boats from the Port of Brunswick, first responders from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Glynn County, and vessels from Sea Tow. Responders were initially able to rescue the pilot and 19 of the 23 crewmembers on board. Four engineering crewmembers remained trapped in the engine room until the following evening, September 9, when responders cut into the vessel’s hull to rescue them. Two crewmembers suffered serious injuries. Total costs for the loss of the vessel were estimated at $62.5 million, and total costs for the loss of the cargo were estimated at $142 million","​​The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the capsizing of the Golden Ray was the chief officer’s error entering ballast quantities into the stability  ​calculation program, which led to his incorrect determination of the vessel’s stability and resulted in the Golden Ray having an insufficient righting arm to counteract the forces developed during a turn while transiting outbound from the Port of Brunswick through St. Simons Sound.
