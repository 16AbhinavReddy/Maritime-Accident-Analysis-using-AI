For about 2 hours prior to the accident, the officer of the watch had been unaware that Priscilla was drifting away from the planned passage. When the officer of the watch realised what had happened, the route chosen to regain the navigational plan resulted in the vessel heading directly into danger. The accident happened because the officer of the watch was distracted from the critical task of monitoring the passage by watching videos on his mobile phone. He was the sole lookout at night as the vessel headed towards land, and the electronic navigation system was not set up to warn of danger ahead.

"On 6 January 2003 the fishing vessel Amber was lost suddenly in the Firth of Forth. The skipper drowned as a result. Amber had departed from Pittenween harbour with just the skipper on board. His son, who normally crewed for him, had been unable to join him because he was ill. During the towing process, the skipper was in contact with other fishermen, and at 1915 he called the owner on his mobile telephone. The owner advised him to call the coastguard to be on the safe side. At 1954, the coastguard received a “Pan-Pan” urgency call. At 2012, communications with Amber were lost and a search for the missing vessel started.

"During the evening of 25 February 2007, on passage in the Baltic Sea, Annabella encountered heavy seas which caused the vessel to roll and pitch heavily. The master reduced speed and adjusted course to reduce the motion and by the early hours of 26 February the vessel had resumed her normal passage. That morning it was discovered that a stack of seven 30 foot cargo containers in bay 12, number 3 hold, had collapsed against the forward part of the hold. This resulted in damage to the containers, the upper three of which contained hazardous cargo, viz: Butylene gas (IMDG Class 2.1).","The collapse of cargo containers occurred as a result of downward compression and racking forces acting on the lower containers of the stack, which were not strong enough to support the stack as their maximum allowable stack weight had been exceeded and no lashing bars had been applied to them. As a result of its analysis of this accident and the ascertainment of its causes and circumstances the MAIB considers that there are shortcomings in the flow of information relating to container stowage between the shippers, planners, the loading terminal and the vessel. While the industry recognises that the master must approve the final loading plan, in practice the pace of modern container operations is such that it is very difficult for ship’s staff to maintain control of the loading plan. The MAIB also considers that the presence in the transport chain of containers that have an allowable stacking weight below the ISO standard should be highlighted by appropriate marking and coding. The safety issues identified in this, and other, published investigation reports, together with issues that are becoming apparent in the MAIB’s ongoing investigation into the structural failure and flooding of the container vessel MSC Napoli (January 2007), identify a compelling need for a Code of Practice for the container shipping industry.","In the Baltic Sea near Gotland Island, Sweden",Collapse of cargo containers during heavy weather on container vessel Annabella,26 February 2007,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

"The tug Ijsselstroom had been working on the construction of a new berth and breakwater in the Port of Peterhead. On the morning of 14 June 2009 she was tasked to act as a stern tug for the barge Tak Boa 1, which was arriving off the port with a cargo of 5000 tonnes of large rocks from Sweden. Ijsselstroom’s skipper chose to deploy her towline over her stern and intended to maintain position and heading relative to the barge by using differential ahead power on her two engines. A bridle wire was not rigged. As the lead tug increased speed, the skipper found that he was unable to control Ijsselstroom’s yawing motion effectively, and 5 minutes after connecting to the barge, the vessel took a large sheer to starboard, girted and capsized.","Van Wijngaarden Marine Services relied too heavily on the individual knowledge and experience of its skippers to carry out a safe operation and did not have a formal staff training programme.

"Fishing vessel Louisa (SY30) sank by the bow and foundered while at anchor in Mingulay Bay. Following recovery and investigation of the wreck, it is concluded that the probable cause of the foundering was flooding of the hold. The skipper and crew were all tired and had gone to bed in the accommodation, and the hold bilge alarm failed to wake them because the alarm sounder in the crew cabin had previously been disabled. When abandoning the vessel, the crew attempted to launch the liferaft. However, the liferaft failed to inflate because its CO2 cylinder was empty, which resulted in the skipper and crew having to enter the water. Although they had all donned lifejackets, the skipper and two crew became unresponsive through cold water immersion and were later found face down in the water by the rescue services. Before abandoning Louisa, the crew activated the vessel’s EPIRB. Although UKMCC had received an initial alert by 0239, the first request for a SAR asset was not made by HMCG until 0322. Had the rescue services arrived on scene earlier, it is possible that there would have been more survivors.","the circumstances of this accident and subsequent trials and testing undertaken following the accident have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the lifejackets worn by Louisa’s skipper and crew

Both vessels were damaged in the collision but were able to proceed to nearby ports for damage assessment. The accident did not result in any injuries or pollution. The MAIB investigation identified that a Very High Frequency (VHF) radio conversation between the two vessels had resulted in the two bridge teams holding conflicting views as to what had been agreed regarding Huayang Endeavour overtaking Seafrontier. Subsequently, Seafrontier’s bridge team did not check for sea room astern before altering course, leading to a close quarter situation between the two vessels. In addition, Seafrontier’s master had been present on the bridge for over 14 hours and was probably suffering from fatigue, which was likely to have had an adverse effect on his decision making.","Seafrontier’s master was operating within his maximum permitted working hours however he was probably experiencing fatigue which resulted in his decision making and reaction times being affected

"Maersk Kendal, a UK registered container ship, ran aground on Monggok Sebarok reef in the Singapore Strait on 16 September 2009. The vessel had altered her course to starboard to give way to three vessels exiting Jong Channel. This caused her to head towards the reef with the intention of altering course to port and resuming her original planned track after passing astern of the third vessel. Despite warnings from Singapore Vessel Traffic Information System, the vessel did not reduce speed or alter course in sufficient time to prevent her from grounding. Substantial damage was sustained to the fore part of the vessel. However, there were no resulting injuries and no pollution.","the movement of the engine telegraph from full ahead manoeuvring to half ahead had no effect on the engine speed; neither the master nor the chief officer appreciated this at the time

"On November 17, 2020​, after departing Portland, Maine, the four crewmembers aboard the 82-foot-long commercial fishing vessel Emmy Rose fished for 5 days in the Gulf of Maine. On November 22, the captain notified a seafood distribution facility in Gloucester, Massachusetts, that they had about 45,000 pounds of assorted fish to offload and expected to arrive at 0600 the following morning. The crew fished for another 4 hours, departing about 1830 for Gloucester. At 0129 on November 23, the US Coast Guard in Boston, Massachusetts, received a distress signal from the emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) registered to the Emmy Rose. There were no distress calls from the vessel before the EPIRB signal. The vessel had traveled about 45 miles to the west over the 7 hours since departing the fishing grounds. Weather conditions recorded by a nearby buoy (about 21 miles from the sinking site) at the time of the EPIRB signal were winds from the east-southeast at 17 knots, gusting to 21 knots, and the sea state was 5.6 feet observed with an easterly sea swell of 5-6 feet. Coast Guard search and rescue assets were deployed to the area of the EPIRB signal, about 27 miles from Provincetown, Massachusetts. Search and rescue efforts continued for 38 hours and covered over 2,200 square miles. During the search, Coast Guard personnel recovered the EPIRB, the liferaft, one life ring, and two wooden fish hold hatch covers from the Emmy Rose. None of the crewmembers were located as of the date of this report, and they are presumed dead. The vessel sank in 794 feet of water and was not recovered. Its estimated value was $325,000.","We determined that the probable cause of the sinking of the fishing vessel Emmy Rose was a sudden loss of stability (capsizing) caused by water collecting on the aft deck and subsequent flooding through deck hatches, which were not watertight or weathertight because they had covers that did not have securing mechanisms, contrary to the vessel’s stability instructions and commercial fishing vessel regulations.​", ,Sinking of Commercial Fishing Vessel Emmy Rose,11/23/2020,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"On 29 August 2015, in daylight and good visibility, the cargo ship Daroja and the bunker barge Erin Wood collided just east of Peterhead, Scotland. Erin Wood was badly damaged and its crew put in danger; there was also some minor pollution from leaking fuel cargo. The accident happened because a proper lookout was not being kept on either vessel. This meant that watchkeepers in both vessels were unaware of the risk of collision and took no action to avoid the other ship.","avoiding collision starts with keeping a good lookout in order to detect other vessels and assess the situation. This is a key principle of safe navigation and should be maintained by all ships at all times

similar to previous MAIB investigations, this accident highlights the potential consequences when the risks associated with the Officer of the Watch (OOW) being the sole lookout are not effectively addressed

a high standard of watchkeeping involves using all the information available on the bridge to build and maintain a good picture. In this case radar, visual and Automatic Identification System (AIS) information could have been utilised more effectively on both ships

the flooding of Erin Wood happened because the vessel was underway with both the upper deck weathertight doors open.

"Early in the morning on 21 November 2020, the scallop dredger Joanna C capsized south of Newhaven, England; only one of the three crew survived. Joanna C’s crew was hauling the gear when they noticed that the starboard dredge bar had become snagged on a line of whelk pots. The snag caused a heel to starboard from which the vessel could not recover, and it capsized rapidly. The MAIB’s investigation found that through-life modifications, culminating in extensive alterations in 2019, had reduced Joanna C’s previously good stability to a state where it had very low reserves of positive stability and increased vulnerability to capsize. The detrimental effect of the modifications was unknown to the crew and regulator alike because, although a stability assessment had begun after the 2019 modifications, the analysis was never completed, and the vessel was free to continue operation. During the capsize Joanna C’s mate was thrown into the water and the skipper later managed to escape as the inverted vessel sank; however, the deckhand remained trapped inside. The vessel’s liferaft did not inflate during the accident because the uninflated liferaft had insufficient buoyancy to initiate the inflation mechanism. The absence of a liferaft adversely affected the survivability of the crew in the sea after the vessel sank.","Reserves of stability are critical to allow fishing vessels to operate safely and ensure recovery back to upright from a heel induced by the environmental conditions or a snagging. Joanna C’s very low margin of positive stability left the vessel extremely vulnerable to capsize.

Liferafts fitted for ‘float-free’ operation must have sufficient buoyancy in the uninflated state to activate the inflation mechanism. Although a buoyancy standard existed for larger SOLAS liferafts there was no corresponding requirement for smaller, non-SOLAS liferafts such as those fitted to fishing vessels.","South of Newhaven, England",Capsize and sinking of scallop dredger Joanna C with loss of 2 lives,21 November 2020,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"On 9 June 2016, a couple were found deceased on board the motor cruiser Love for Lydia, which was moored alongside Wroxham Island, River Bure, Norfolk. The couple died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Our investigation identified that:

the source of the carbon monoxide was exhaust fumes from the boat’s large inboard petrol engine
the engines exhaust emissions contained very high levels of CO even when idling
the boat’s habitable spaces were not adequately ventilated; the forepeak cabin’s deck hatch and port holes were shut
the boat’s occupants were not alerted to the danger because a carbon monoxide alarm was not fitted","occupants of vessels without carbon monoxide alarms will have no warning if the lethal is present in habitable areas. It is essential that carbon monoxide sensors are fitted in areas where carbon monoxide could accumulate and pose a risk to health (such as the accommodation areas of motor cruisers)

"On 26 August 2018, Wight Sky suffered a catastrophic main engine failure as it prepared to enter the Lymington River on its regular crossing from Yarmouth, Isle of Wight. This was the ferry’s second catastrophic main engine failure in less than a year, the failed engine being the replacement for the previous failure that had resulted in a fire and serious injuries to an engineer officer. On 14 December 2018, Wight Sky suffered a third catastrophic engine failure. On this occasion, the failed engine was a new build and had been in operation for just 389 hours. Wight Sky was one of three Wight Class sister ferries and following the third engine failure Wightlink withdrew its Wight Class ferries from service. Following discussions between the ferry owner, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Lloyd’s Register, and the engine manufacturer Volvo Penta, a mitigation plan was put in place to enable the ferries to return to service. This investigation found a history of engine failures across the Wight Class fleet dating back to 2010 and consequently, the scope of the investigation expanded to include all known failures. This led to a long and detailed technical investigation that comprised forensic examination and testing of five of the failed engines and their components, a full review of the vessels’ system design and operation, and the safety management, planned maintenance and condition monitoring procedures, together with manning and technical oversight.

"On the morning of 2 May 2021, the skipper of single-handed creel fishing vessel Saint Peter was shooting creels east of Torness Point, Scotland. There were no witnesses to the accident but it is likely that one of the skipper’s legs became entangled in a bight of rope while attempting to unsnag a string of creels and was pulled overboard. The skipper was wearing a personal flotation device (PFD), which fully inflated and kept him afloat, but once in the water he was unable to raise an alarm or reboard his vessel. A concerned relative and a friend of the skipper searched for and found Saint Peter unmanned with a string of creels steaming from its shooting door.

The vessel was later refloated and drydocked for repair. No pollution was reported. Damage to the vessel was estimated at $2.5 million.","We determined that the probable cause of the grounding of the passenger ferry Commodore was the loss of the primary control system for the catamaran’s port water jets and propulsion engines due to a flaw in the system manufacturer’s software causing a memory card failure. Contributing to the casualty was the company’s lack of clear safety management system procedures for primary control system failure and ineffective oversight of crew training on failure modes for loss of propulsion and steering control, resulting in the captain not identifying the nature of the loss of control and either engaging back-up control or using emergency engine shutdowns to stop the vessel.","Brooklyn, NY",Grounding of Passenger Ferry Commodore,6/5/2021,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

The vessel remained afloat with a few centimetres of the wheelhouse protruding above the water. Two RNLI lifeboats arrived at the scene within 15 minutes of the capsize and Laura Jane was towed to the nearby Batten Bay beach, arriving at around 1400. The skipper was extracted from the wheelhouse by two of the RNLI crew who broke a wheelhouse window to get access to him. He was immersed in water, was unconscious and not breathing. Attempts to resuscitate him by the lifeboat crew and paramedics from the emergency services were unsuccessful. He was then airlifted to Derriford Hospital, where he was pronounced deceased at 1450.","The weight of the fishing gear on Laura Jane reduced its freeboard to the extent that water entered the vessel through its freeing ports, causing it to capsize.

"At 1137 on 4 May 2017, the UK registered container ship CMA CGM Centaurus made heavy contact with the quay and two shore cranes while under pilotage during its arrival at Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates. The accident resulted in the collapse of a shore crane and 10 injuries, including one serious injury, to shore personnel. The accident occurred because the ship was unable to attain a sufficiently high rate of turn into a basin in preparation for berthing. The pilot was unaware of the ship’s speed, and the ship’s bridge team were uncertain of the maximum speed required to complete the turn safely. There was no agreed plan for the intended manoeuvre, and therefore no shared mental model between the bridge team and the pilot. Consequently, the pilot was operating in isolation without the support of the bridge team, allowing the pilot’s decision-making to become a single system point of failure. The pilot’s performance was focused on efficiency, which influenced his decision to turn the ship into the basin without ensuring that the manoeuvre was conducted at a sufficiently slow speed to enable its safe completion.","The master/pilot exchange carried out on CMA CGM Centaurus lacked structure and detail. There was little further detail as the approach proceeded. By not actively engaging with the bridge team, the pilot effectively signalled that he did not need their assistance. The bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared mental model for the intended manoeuvre.

By not requiring its newly recruited pilots to undertake BRM-P training, Jebel Ali port authority missed the opportunity to both emphasise its commitment to the effective integration of its pilots with bridge teams, and ensure its pilots were trained/refreshed in the principles of BRM. Despite extensive industry guidance, there continues to be a reluctance by masters and pilots to work together in accordance with the principles of BRM.

Many of the factors in this accident can be attributed to a focus on completing acts of pilotage as quickly as possible. The priorities set at senior management level have a significant impact on the safety culture of a port, and there is a need to recognise that time-pressure, in the quest for terminal efficiency or financial reward, can have a negative effect.","Port of Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates",Heavy contact made by container vessel CMA CGM Centaurus with quay and shore cranes,4 May 2017,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

"At around 1630 on 28 August 2005, the UK-registered trawler, Harvest Hope came fast while trawling in the vicinity of seabed pipelines, approximately 40 miles north-east of Peterhead. The aft net drum space immediately began to flood through the port transom door, which had been inadvertently left open from the previous voyage. A port list quickly developed, which worsened as more water poured in through the transom door. The crew immediately tried to close the open door using the hydraulic ram, but this became damaged by a green sea, and the door could not be closed. As the port list increased, main hydraulic power was lost, resulting in the brakes on the vessel’s automatic trawl winch system activating. With no safe and easy means of releasing these brakes, the vessel was effectively anchored to the seabed on the port side. Although the trawl warps were cut with an electric grinder, the vessel’s condition failed to improve. Despite some difficulties, the crew managed to deploy the starboard liferaft, and as the list critically increased, the crew abandoned into the liferaft, around 15 minutes after first coming fast. Shortly afterwards, the vessel capsized, and sank by the stern. Not all of the crew had been able to put on their lifejackets. A nearby fishing vessel, Fruitful Bough had responded to the earlier “Mayday” issued by Harvest Hope, and safely recovered the crew at about 1700, returning to Peterhead later that day.`","The vessel’s as-built displacement was greater than originally designed, due to the addition of large amounts of solid ballast for stability purposes.

The vessel broached and was capsized in unusually high waves, resulting in both its skipper and crewman entering the water. Neither was wearing a personal flotation device; the crewman managed to swim ashore but unfortunately the skipper drowned. Our investigation determined that the skipper struck his head during the capsize, which may have affected his ability to swim.

The skipper’s extensive knowledge of the local conditions did not prevent him being caught out by the size of the waves, which were hard to judge from out at sea and not evident in any forecasts.

Open fishing vessels have a higher risk of capsizing, particularly in steep waves, compared with decked vessels and so it is important that fishermen reduce the risk of broaching and capsize by taking suitable precautions and prepare for a capsize happening.

The wearing of personal floatation devices is now mandatory following the significant numbers of fishermen who have drowned following fishing vessel accidents.

"On 4 August 2018, the UK registered container vessel, ANL Wyong, and the Italian registered gas carrier, King Arthur, collided in darkness, dense fog and an area of heavy shipping traffic, south-east of Gibraltar; both vessels were destined for Algeciras, Spain. ANL Wyong was stopped and waiting for a pilot as there was no berth immediately available; King Arthur was heading towards a boat transfer position near Algeciras. The accident happened because neither vessel appreciated the risk of collision in sufficient time to take effective avoiding action and pass at a safe distance. The investigation has also highlighted risks associated with the inappropriate use of VHF radio and AIS information when assessing risk of collision. The collision occurred within a recognised vessel traffic service (VTS) area; however, the vessels were not warned of the developing risk by the shore authority responsible for traffic safety in the area.","although both vessels were monitoring the shipping situation, neither bridge team responded effectively to the developing, hazardous situation

on board ANL Wyong, the officer of the watch was aware of numerous other vessels approaching, but perceived that they would all keep clear, so took no action

"On 25 June 1999 in the port of Dover the ro-ro passenger ferry P&OSL Calais was conducting a routine crew training exercise. An empty lifeboat was raised and when in position the winch operator stopped the motor. The winch then went into reverse involuntarily, allowing the boat to lower until the bowsing gear took its weight. The manufacturers of the winch identified the loss of control as being caused by the failure of the one-way clutch on the winch’s drive motor. Although unable to offer supporting data, they also offered the opinion that this failure was because the clutch had been filled with oil of too great a viscosity. MAIB’s records showed that similar failures had occurred on other vessels having winches fitted with clutches of similar design, fortunately without serious consequences. In light of these failures, the MAIB decided that its investigation should cover the likely effects of incorrect lubricant on the performance of this type of clutch.","one-way clutch failure on No 5 lifeboat winch of P&OSL Calais was probably caused by the use of incorrect lubricant

CV24 could not be freed and was abandoned with all the crew rescued safely. CV24 had been sailing south and downwind with a spinnaker hoisted, intending to pass clear of land and into the Southern Ocean. During this coastal passage, there was a significant shift in the wind direction which resulted in the yacht being turned towards the shore in order to prevent an unwanted gybe. The skipper realised that a planned gybe would be necessary to head back towards the open sea; however, this turn came too late to avoid running aground. Seven of the 11 other yachts in the race also headed inshore and, in similar circumstances to CV24, CV31 almost certainly grounded but did not stop and was able to continue the race.","CV24 was not safely manned or operated as the skipper was the only qualified, professional seafarer on board, and there was no dedicated navigator with responsibility for passage planning and execution

"​​On July 23, 2022, about 1314 local time, the bulk carrier Bunun Queen, transiting eastbound in the Gulf of Mexico with 20 crewmembers on board, and the northbound offshore supply vessel Thunder collided about 66 miles south of Port Fourchon, Louisiana. The Thunder sustained substantial damage to its port side, which resulted in the flooding of one of its propulsion rooms and three other spaces. Eleven of Thunder’s 18 crew were evacuated to a Good Samaritan vessel, and the remaining crew stayed with the vessel to control the flooding while it was towed back to port. There were no injuries, and no pollution was reported. Damage to both vessels was estimated at $12.3 million.","​We determined that the probable cause of the collision between the bulk carrier Bunun Queen and the offshore supply vessel Thunder was the Bunun Queen officer’s distraction due to performing non navigational tasks and the Thunder officer’s distraction due to cell phone use, which kept both officers from keeping a proper lookout. Contributing to the casualty was the Thunder’s officer on watch not following his company’s watchkeeping policies.","Port Fourchon, LA",Collision between Bulk Carrier Bunun Queen and Offshore Supply Vessel Thunder,7/23/2022,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An oil sheen approximately 400 yards by 1 mile was visible in the water after the sinking. The estimated property damage exceeded $162,000.",​​The probable cause of the fire aboard the fishing vessel Master D was leaking lube oil from the diesel generator that contacted a hot engine surface and ignited.

"​​​On December 31, 2019, US Coast Guard Communications Detachment Kodiak received a distress call from the fishing vessel Scandies Rose. The vessel was en route from Kodiak to fishing grounds in the Bering Sea when it capsized about 2.5 miles south of Sutwik Island, Alaska, and sank several minutes later. At the time of the accident, the Scandies Rose had seven crewmembers aboard, two of whom were rescued by the Coast Guard several hours later. The other missing crewmembers were not found and are presumed dead. The Scandies Rose, valued at $15 million, was declared a total loss. According to the surviving crewmembers, the vessel had begun to encounter freezing spray and accumulate ice from 0200 to 0800 on the day of the accident. By 2037, the captain of the Scandies Rose noted that his vessel was icing ""really bad"" and had developed a 20° starboard list. He was trying to seek shelter southeast of Sutwik Island, but when he changed course, the vessel's list worsened. At 2155, the captain of the Scandies Rose​ broadcasted a mayday call.","The probable cause of the capsizing and sinking of the commercial fishing vessel Scandies Rose was the inaccurate stability instructions for the vessel, which resulted in a low margin of stability to resist capsizing, combined with the heavy asymmetric ice accumulation on the vessel due to localized wind and sea conditions that were more extreme than forecasted during the accident voyage.​","Sutwik Island, AK",Capsizing and Sinking of Commercial Fishing Vessel ​Scandies Rose,12/31/2019,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"On 13 December 1998 five men were crossing the Sound of Iona, on the west coast of Scotland, in a small dinghy with outboard engine. The dinghy pitched into a wave, capsized and threw all five occupants into the sea. None were wearing lifejackets so clung to floating objects or the upturned boat. One man, separated from the others, swam to shore and raised the alarm. The other four men died.",The accident was caused by the failure of the well laden dinghy to rise to an oncoming wave that nobody onboard had seen in the dark. Sufficient water was shipped to destroy all residual buoyancy and the capsize that followed was inevitable. The lack of lifejackets denied four young men an opportunity to survive.
