        "1. **Unsafe Acts**: These Influences or Factors are closely tied to the mishap and described as active failures or actions committed by an individual that result in a human event.\n",
        "These are divided into 4 categories:\n",
        "(i) *Decision error*: Actions and plans unintentionally chosen by operators are inappropriate and lead to unsafe situations.\n",
        "(ii) *Skill-based error*: Unintentional errors that can be reduced through learning. The actions are related to a routine task or procedure.\n",
        "(iii) *Perceptual error*: Misperception of an object, equipment, environment, threat, or situation; visual, auditory, proprioceptive, or vestibular illusions; cognitive or attention failures.\n",
        "(iv) *Routine violation*: Intentionally ignoring established rules and procedures.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Preconditions for Unsafe Acts**: When environmental factors or conditions of individuals affect performance and this condition contributes to an error.\n",
        "These are divided into 9 categories:\n",
        "(i) *Physical environment*: When factors such as weather, climate, fog, brownout (dust or sand storm) or whiteout (snow storm) affect the actions of individual.\n",
        "(ii) *Technical environment*: These are factors when automation or the design of the workspace affects the actions of an individual.\n",
        "(iii) *Personnel Factors*: When teamwork or self-imposed stress affect practices, conditions, or actions of an individual’s performance. Communication Refers to the interactions among individuals, crews, and teams involved with the preparation and/or performance of a mission that resulted in an error or an unsafe situation.\n",
        "(iv) *Self-Imposed Stress*: These are factors when an individual demonstrates disregard for rules that govern the individual’s readiness to perform or exhibits poor judgment when it comes to readiness and this contributes to an error.\n",
        "(v) *Individual Factors*: This is a factor in a mishap if cognitive, psycho-behavioral, adverse physical state, or physical/mental limitations affect practices, conditions or actions of individuals and result in human error or an unsafe situation.\n",
        "(vi) *Awareness Cognitive Factors*: These are factors when attention management conditions affect an individual’s performance and this state contributes to an error.\n",
        "(vii) *Adverse Psychological*: These are factors when an individual experiences a psychological event that compromises performance and this condition contributes to an error.\n",
        "(viii) *Medical / Mental*: These are factors when an individual, temporarily or permanently, lacks the physical or mental capabilities to cope with a situation and this condition contributes to an error.\n",
        "(ix) *Perception*: These are factors resulting in degraded sensory inputs (visual, auditory or vestibular) that create a misperception of an object, threat or situation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Unsafe Supervision**: Is a factor in a mishap if the methods, decisions or policies of the supervisory chain of command directly affect practices, conditions, or individual actions and result in human error or an unsafe situation.\n",
        "These are divided into 4 categories:\n",
        "(i) *Inadequate supervision*: This is a factor in a mishap when supervision proves inappropriate or improper and fails to identify hazard, recognize and control risk, provide guidance, training and/or oversight and results in human error or an unsafe situation.\n",
        "(ii) *Planned inappropriate operation*: These are factors when supervision fails to adequately assess the hazards associated with an operation and allows for unnecessary risk. It is also a factor when supervision allows non-proficient or inexperienced personnel to attempt missions beyond their capability or when crew or flight makeup is inappropriate for the task or mission.\n",
        "(iii) *Failed to correct problem*: These are factors in a mishap when supervision fails to correct known deficiencies in documents, processes or procedures, or fails to correct inappropriate or unsafe actions of individuals, and this lack of supervisory action creates an unsafe situation.\n",
        "(iv) *Supervisory violation*: These are factors in a mishap when supervision while managing organizational assets willfully disregards instructions, guidance, rules, or operating instructions and this lack of supervisory responsibility creates an unsafe situation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Organizational Influences**: This level describes the methods, decisions or policies of an organization and how they affect both supervisory and individual task and mission accomplishment.\n",
        "These are divided into 3 categories:\n",
        "(i) *Resource management*: These are factors when the people or products an organization needs to accomplish a mission are inadequate or improper and this condition reduces system safety or increases operational risk.\n",
        "(ii) *Organizational process*: These are factors when organizational processes, procedures, risk management and oversight negatively impact operations.\n",

The vessel’s controllable pitch propeller system may have lost up to 1,632 gallons of hydraulic oil. There were no injuries reported. Damage to the vessel was estimated at $3.03 million. Safety Issue : ​We determined that the probable cause of the loss of propulsion on the containership Maunalei was a crack developing in a controllable pitch propeller blade base and progressing into a fracture due to high cycle fatigue as a result of the blade not meeting manufacturer design specifications.​\"\n",

The four crewmembers on board were unable to stem the flooding, and they abandoned the vessel to a responding US Coast Guard boat. The Captain Alex later sank, and an oil sheen and debris field were visible; a reported 17,000 gallons of diesel fuel were on board. There were no injuries. The Captain Alex, with a value of $500,000, was a total loss. Safety Issue : ​​We determined that the probable cause of the sinking of the fishing vessel Captain Alex was uncontrolled flooding through a hole—possibly caused by steel hull plating deterioration—beneath the engine room.​​​​​\"\n",

The crew had evacuated 2 days prior due to forecasted adverse weather in the area, leaving the vessel elevated out of the water and unattended. Following the casualty, vessel crewmembers, salvors, and personnel from the operating company assessed the damage and facilitated the tow of the vessel into port. No pollution or injuries were reported. Damage to the vessel and cargo was estimated at $6.9 million.​ Safety Issue : ​We determined that the probable cause of the tilting of the elevated liftboat L/B Robert was gale-force winds combined with waves that exceeded the vessel’s air gap, causing vessel movement, which led to a leg sliding into an adjacent can hole in the seafloor.​\""
